In mobile view you can still scroll with a page up: 
For example the swimming times page you can scroll in the background and no graph is displayed on mobile
Make it so that when scrolling through a sheet the side page of the atheletes is condensed to a initial and then the top row also follows you so you can alwasy see what you are looking at. 
When signing in it takes multiple sign in attempts do sucessfully sign in
