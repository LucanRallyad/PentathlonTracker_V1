When generating the swimming seed times I needs to filter groups into men and women, right now it just filters on seedtime but it also needs to account for gender cause only men can be in a heat and only women can be in a heat. To add onto this make a card where you can manually input swim seed data and then generate the starting line based of that, as well I want to be able to drag to reorder the athletes instead of having to click the up and down arrows.
Double check the swimming points calculations and input data as when somethings is inputted in minuites it is automatically 595 points, so we need to make sure that it understands data inputted in minutes:seconds. or in 0:seconds or in :seconds or in just seconds.
I want to change the schedule tab under competition to be an actual calender view so its easier to see
To add to the live feed tab put a search bar to be able to filter to that specific athelete to only see their updates
I want to be able to also compare to world records and other athelets and compeititons from the UIPM website 
When adding athletes I should just be able to click their name in the search bar and it should automatically add to list It should just add the information into the bottom area and then having to click the "+ competition" button
