Create a new tab under all login views on the sidebar, This tab should be called Rankings and should display the current national rankings. I would like a format similar to the current results tab that is already in the system. Take the information form @Pentathlon-Canada-_-Selection-Policy-003.pdf to determine the rankings.
When creating a new competition currently you can only add event blocks that are 1 hour long, please redo the time system so its able to add events for however long. 
Under the super admin area add and area that I can upload excel documents from past competitons to be able to input their data into the current system. The software needs to be able to read through the excel file and figure out what data is appropriate and sort it into a competition. I do have a question regarding this request, would I get better resuilts if I linked a cluade api into the system so that claude can look through the files?
